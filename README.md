# Resource Protection Simulation

This is a simple Python program that simulates a resource protection system. It demonstrates basic access control where users can access their own documents, and an admin can access all documents.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `app.py`.
3. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```

## Usage

When the program runs, it will prompt you for:
1. **Username**: Enter a username (e.g., `userA`, `userB`, `admin`).
2. **Document ID**: Enter the ID of the document you want to access (e.g., `1`, `2`).
